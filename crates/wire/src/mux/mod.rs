//! Sans-io multiplexer state machine.
//!
//! One `Multiplexer<N, C>` per underlying byte pipe. Slot index doubles
//! as stream id. Per-slot `gen: u16` defeats stale-frame races across
//! re-use. Credit-based per-stream flow control. Single pending wire
//! write so applications drive their own outbound queues.
//!
//! `recv(bytes) -> Vec<Event>` and `poll_send() -> Option<EncodedFrame>`
//! are the entire I/O-shaped surface; transports glue them to actual
//! sockets.
