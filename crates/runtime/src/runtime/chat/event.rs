/// call are emitted contiguously and atomically. `ToolCallStart` is not
/// "the model just emitted `<tool_call>`" — it is "the parser has
/// completed and validated a call, and is now emitting its wire-level
/// frames." Validation (name lookup, schema check) happens before any
/// of the three are emitted; partial / invalid calls take the
/// [`Self::UnknownTool`] / [`Self::InvalidArgs`] / [`Self::ParseError`]
/// path instead and never produce a `ToolCallStart` for that call.
///
/// Per-call streaming (the second tool call in a response is delivered
/// as soon as its closing sentinel arrives, even while later output is
/// still being generated) is the wire-level streaming guarantee. True
/// per-token argument streaming would require partial-JSON parsing and
/// is out of scope.

/// `UnknownTool`, `InvalidArgs`, and `ParseError` are **terminal**.
/// After emitting any of them, the parser MUST also emit
/// [`StopReason::ProtocolError`] and then return empty from any
/// subsequent `feed` / `finish` call. This means the gateway never has
/// to render both an error and a "success" finish for the same
/// generation — the parser commits to the error and is done.
