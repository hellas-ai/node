//! The provider's real execution backend, behind the paid gate.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! One implementation of [`PaidEvaluateBackend`], over this crate's own
//! Evaluate engine. The gate that decides whether a backend may be
//! called at all is [`hellas_work::work::run_accepted_work`]'s, and it is
//! not here: it belongs beside the journal that records the decision,
//! and a second copy of it in front of one backend would be a second
//! opinion about when a paid job may run.
//!
//! So what is here is exactly the seam. A request that this endpoint
//! rebuilt from its own journal goes in; the complete signed transcript
//! of one invocation comes back, or a fault does.
//!
//! # Invoked once
//!
//! Not by anything in this file. This starts the engine every time it is
//! called, and that is the honest shape for it: what makes a second call
//! not come is the running marker the gate journaled, and nothing here
//! can see one.
//!
//! Which is also to say what this is not: a paid gate on the executor's
//! own front door. An owner of the [`ExecutorHandle`] can call it
//! directly and get an execution for nothing, because the handle is held
//! in-process and no RPC route exposes it.
//!
//! One thing this file must not do, and deliberately does not: consult
//! the engine's completed-execution map. That map is keyed by request
//! commitment, so a second paid job carrying the same request would be
//! answered out of the first one's transcript, with nothing invoked and
//! a price charged. `EvaluateEngine::start_prepared_input` instead creates
//! one fresh invocation and hands it to the actor's owed FIFO exactly once.
//!
//! # What is not covered by a test here
//!
//! That the exact Catena environment, given this request, produces that
//! transcript. Running it needs a compatible GPU and the committed content,
//! so the ordinary unit suite does not execute this path end to end; the ROCm
//! integration test does. What the gate does with a transcript, and how many
//! times it asks for one, is tested against a counting double at this trait in
//! `hellas-rpc`.
