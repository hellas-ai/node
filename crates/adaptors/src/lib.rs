//! Adaptors between LLM provider wire formats and the canonical
//! execution vocabulary.
//!
//! # Ownership boundary with `hellas-rpc`
//!
//! This crate owns **provider-shape conversion**: parsing OpenAI /
//! Anthropic request and response JSON, SSE framing, and rendering
//! between those formats and the canonical [`OutputEvent`] vocabulary.
//!
//! It does **not** own **transcript payload encoding**. The signed
//! dag-cbor codecs that turn `OutputEvent`s into the bytes a producer
//! commits to live in `hellas_rpc::{evaluate, fetch}` — because those
//! bytes are signed, their shape is protocol surface, not a provider
//! detail. This crate re-exports the vocabulary it renders (from
//! `hellas_rpc::output`) and nothing more; it never re-exports or
//! reimplements the codecs. The dependency flows one way — adaptors →
//! rpc — so rpc stays free of any provider knowledge.
//!
//! Rule of thumb: if the bytes get signed, the codec belongs in rpc; if
//! the bytes match a vendor's HTTP API, the conversion belongs here.
