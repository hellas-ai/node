//! Handing finalized blocks to a paid endpoint's watcher.
//!
//! # Why an adapter and not a blanket impl
//!
//! The watcher's block source is `hellas_rpc::work_close::FinalizedBlocks`
//! and a light client is `crate::LightClient`. Both are foreign to each
//! other, so nothing can implement the first for every one of the
//! second; [`WorkBlocks`] is the one type that owns that pairing. It
//! adds no policy — every decision it could make is made by
//! [`FinalizedBlockView::decode`] above it or by the journal below it.
//!
//! # What crosses
//!
//! One block, checked. `decode` is what turns a bag of bytes beside a
//! finalization certificate into a block: it hashes the bytes against
//! the payload the certificate names, decodes them with the validator's
//! own codec, and checks the height and state root. Only then are the
//! transactions in it facts.
//!
//! They cross in consensus order, and the non-kernel ones are dropped
//! rather than reordered. That is not a projection the watcher has to
//! trust: a transfer or a merge cannot open a contest or close an edge,
//! so the relative order of everything that *can* is exactly the
//! validator's.
//!
//! # And one way back
//!
//! The same pairing carries a transaction *out*. An endpoint that could
//! read blocks and not submit would sign a start it had no way to hand
//! to anyone, so the sink is here rather than in a second adapter — one
//! light client, one channel, one direction each way.
//!
//! # And the state behind the blocks
//!
//! A setup driver needs a third thing: one coherent read of the two
//! edges, the bond's lease, and the liveness of the coins its retained
//! Opens spend. That is [`FinalizedWorkView`], and it is on the same
//! light client, so it is on the same adapter rather than a second one
//! a caller could pair with a different chain. What crosses is
//! [`FinalizedSetup`], which is `hellas_rpc`'s owned shape of the same
//! answer; the coherence it carries is the snapshot's, and
//! `WorkChannelSnapshot::finalized_setup` is what refuses to produce
//! one from a snapshot that asked about other coins.
