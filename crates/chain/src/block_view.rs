//! Reading one finalized block, and finding one transaction in it.
//!
//! # What a finalized block proves, and what it does not
//!
//! A [`crate::FinalizedBlock`] is a snapshot and a bag of bytes. The
//! snapshot's finalization certificate proves that a quorum finalized a
//! payload digest; it says nothing about the bytes beside it, and
//! nothing about what those bytes contain. [`FinalizedBlockView::decode`]
//! is the step that closes that gap: it hashes the bytes, compares them
//! with the payload the certificate named, decodes them exactly, and
//! checks the block's own height and state root against the snapshot's.
//!
//! Only then is "this transaction is in this block" a fact. An endpoint
//! that trusted the bytes because the snapshot beside them was signed
//! would accept any block from a peer willing to attach a real
//! certificate to it.
//!
//! # Why the codec is not copied
//!
//! The block a client decodes and the block a validator proposed have to
//! be the same object, so this reads [`crate::HellasBlock`] rather than a
//! second definition of it. A private endpoint decoder that agreed with
//! the validator's until one of them changed is how a client comes to
//! believe a transaction was accepted when it was not.
