//! The one coherent finalized read a paid work channel is decided from.
//!
//! # Why one read rather than several
//!
//! A work channel is four pieces of consensus state: the tag-4 bond
//! edge, the tag-2 payment edge, the bond's lease slots, and the payment
//! edge's pending-close slot. An endpoint that fetched them one at a
//! time would be answering from up to four different states, and the
//! combinations that produces are not hypothetical — a payment edge from
//! before a contest opened, beside a lease from after the bond was timed
//! out, reads as a healthy channel and is not one.
//!
//! A channel being *set up* is those four and one more: whether the
//! coins the two retained Opens spend are still there. That question
//! belongs to the same read for a sharper version of the same reason.
//! `SetupState::decide` locks a provider's stake only if the client's
//! payment funding is live, and a coin read at a later state than the
//! edges is a premise about a state the decision is not being made at.
//! Which coins those are is not derivable here, so the query carries
//! them.
//!
//! So [`WorkChannelSnapshot`] is one answer at one finalized block, read
//! under one database snapshot, and it carries the block it was read at
//! so a caller can say which state it acted on. The existing point
//! queries cannot be composed into this: `LightClient::get_edge` treats
//! its payload argument as a finalized *floor* and reads the
//! then-current database root, which is a different question.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It does not authenticate the objects. In this milestone's trusted
//! mode the endpoint and the chain process share a trust boundary, and
//! the values here are unproved database replies. `finalization` proves
//! that a quorum finalized *the block*; it says nothing about whether an
//! object field in the reply belongs to that block's state. Nothing here
//! may be described as an authenticated object read until the RPC
//! carries membership and nonmembership proofs against the verified
//! state root.
//!
//! # What it does not decide
//!
//! Whether the channel is usable. This module reports what is there;
//! `hellas_rpc::protocol::work_setup` decides what that means. The shape
//! of the two registry answers is not decided here either: the kernel's
//! own [`parse_bond_lease`] and [`parse_pending_close`] are called, so
//! an endpoint and a close cannot disagree about what a slot holds.
