//! The black-box question: against a real chain, does the provider's
//! finalized balance go up by the job price, and for the right reason?
//!
//! # What is real here
//!
//! - **The committee.** Six validator identities, a real threshold deal
//!   over them, and a real BLS finalization certificate over every
//!   block, verified by [`ConsensusVerifier`] inside each node's own
//!   follower indexer. A forged certificate does not get in.
//! - **Six nodes.** Each has its own QMDB database, its own kernel
//!   execution, its own owner index, its own indexer and its own
//!   mempool. Every block is executed independently by all six and
//!   [`Devnet::seal`] refuses to finalize one unless all six agree on
//!   the state root. The provider reads and submits at node 0; the
//!   client reads and submits at node 1, so neither party's evidence
//!   comes from the other's view.
//! - **Genesis.** A real [`Genesis`] document, validated, its network id
//!   read back through [`crate::domain::network_id`], and its two
//!   allocations parsed by the shipped
//!   [`crate::config::parse_genesis_settlement_key`] — which is what
//!   makes funding a secp256k1 settlement key a real event here rather
//!   than an assumption.
//! - **The channel.** Both Opens are the handshake's own signed bytes,
//!   submitted by the setup driver through a light client and finalized
//!   in real blocks. Nothing about the edges is fabricated.
//! - **The job.** A real [`ProviderEndpoint`] behind a real
//!   [`WorkService`], reached by a real [`ClientEndpoint`] over a real
//!   multiplexed transport, with both journals on disk.
//! - **The close.** The runner's production clock entry
//!   ([`advance_paid_work_clock`]) drives the start and response, submits
//!   the adjudicated close from one coherent finalized read, and returns
//!   the completed bond at its horizon from that same read.
//!
//! # What is simulated, exactly
//!
//! 1. **The proposer.** No simplex engine runs. [`Devnet::seal`] plays
//!    the leader: it drains every node's mempool, executes the result on
//!    all six, and certifies the block with the six real schemes. So
//!    ordering, view changes, leader rotation and gossip are *not*
//!    exercised — and neither is the fan-in a real proposer gets, since
//!    `seal` reads all six mempools directly. There is no library edge
//!    that spawns a validator into a caller's runtime:
//!    `crate::validator::run` (crates/chain/src/validator.rs:884) is
//!    private, reads a TOML path, binds sockets and owns its own tokio
//!    runtime, so six of them cannot share one test process.
//! 2. **The model.** [`FixtureExecutor`] is not `hellas-executor`; this
//!    repository has no model weights to run. Both sides invoke the same
//!    `FixtureExecutor`, which is what "the same executor
//!    implementation" means here, and the reproduction seam is the real
//!    [`Reproducer`] trait with the real derivation around it.
//! 3. **The provider's prompt lookup.** A shipped provider resolves the
//!    accepted bundle from its artifact store; here the provider's
//!    backend is handed the prompt at construction. The *client's* side
//!    is not stubbed: it derives its question from the journal-held
//!    bundle through [`hellas_client::work::reproduce::plan`].
//! 4. **The timer.** The test advances the production paid-work clock
//!    entry at explicit proposer turns rather than waiting on `serve`'s
//!    wall-clock interval. Every provider-clock transaction still comes
//!    from that entry; only when a tick occurs is controlled here.
//! 5. **Transports.** No ALPN advertisement, no peer discovery and no
//!    gateway. Both endpoints are constructed directly and the paid
//!    exchange runs over a mux pair on in-memory pipes — real framing
//!    and real method routing, no network.
//!
//! Nothing else is stood in for. In particular no balance, no payout, no
//! certificate and no edge value below is written by this file. The final
//! coin values that prove settlement are read from a node's finalized QMDB;
//! whole-owner assertions also refuse unless the owner-index projection
//! names exactly the same fixture coins and values as those QMDB reads.
//!
//! # What the §1 fan-out gap costs this test
//!
//! `serve`'s clock reads and submits through the first validator that
//! answers (`crates/cli/src/commands/serve/node.rs:773-778`), and §1's
//! concurrent fan-out to all six does not exist. This harness has the
//! same shape by construction: each party is pinned to one node. So what
//! is proved is that the money is right *when one honest validator
//! answers a party*. It is not proved that a party censored at its one
//! validator still gets paid, because there is no second submission path
//! for it to fall back to — in this test or in the tree. The one thing
//! the six nodes do buy is that no party's *evidence* is the other's:
//! the provider's balance is read at node 0 and confirmed at node 1, and
//! every block is executed six times before it is finalized.
