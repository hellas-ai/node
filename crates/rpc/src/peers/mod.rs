//! Sans-io peer registry and admission policy primitives.
//!
//! This module is the pure state engine for peer facts. It intentionally has no
//! transport, runtime, clock, or storage dependencies. Callers pass timestamps
//! and observations in, and the registry returns deterministic state changes and
//! admission decisions.
//!
//! Most application code should use [`PeerManager`] instead of calling
//! [`PeerRegistry::apply`] directly. The intended layering is:
//!
//! - a transport/discovery driver owns discovery streams and records facts here
//!   before notifying application code;
//! - generated or hand-written RPC clients acquire/release request permits here
//!   around actual RPC calls;
//! - RPC servers record inbound calls with `observe_inbound_request` for
//!   accounting and admission, but do not infer service capabilities from those
//!   calls;
//! - application code queries the current registry view, usually through a
//!   manager snapshot/view API, rather than hand-feeding events.
//!
//! In other words, the registry is the source of truth, not the discovery task
//! and not an event stream. Events are useful for notification, but polling
//! events should never be required to keep peer state correct.
