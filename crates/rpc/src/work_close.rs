//! Spending the certificate: the finalized cursor, and the two
//! transactions that turn a signed scalar into coins.
//!
//! # Why the cursor is the load-bearing part
//!
//! Five rules elsewhere in this crate are decided against a height —
//! whether a receipt is timely, whether a payment is timely, whether a
//! job's deadlines are still reachable, whether plaintext released now
//! can still arrive, and whether a readiness decision may be acted on.
//! Every one of them reads
//! [`ChannelState::cursor`](crate::work_store::ChannelState::cursor). Until this module
//! there was no writer for it outside tests, and a cursor that never
//! moves makes every one of those rules pass: a receipt three hundred
//! blocks late reads as timely against a height that stopped.
//!
//! So the cursor is not the plumbing around the close. It is what makes
//! the deadlines mean anything, and [`observe`] is the only thing that
//! moves it.
//!
//! # Contiguous, or not at all
//!
//! [`observe`] takes one block and commits one
//! [`ChannelRecord::CursorAdvanced`], and that record refuses anything
//! but the next height whose parent is the block already held. A
//! notification that the chain has reached height 900 is a wake-up; it
//! is not evidence that this endpoint read 880 through 899, and the
//! close and the deadline those blocks may have carried are exactly
//! what it would be missing.
//!
//! [`catch_up`] is therefore a loop and not a jump. A block the source
//! cannot supply stops it, and the cursor stays where it was — which
//! makes every gate above fail closed rather than pass on a stale
//! height.
//!
//! # What a watcher looks for
//!
//! Two things, both on this channel's own payment edge. An accepted
//! [`Move::StartPaymentClose`](hellas_kernel::Move::StartPaymentClose) means a contest is live, and the height
//! that accepted it is the only place the contest's identifier can come
//! from — the kernel derives [`StartId`](hellas_kernel::StartId) from the start
//! digest *and*
//! the inclusion height, so no retained signature determines it. An
//! accepted [`Tx::Close`] means the edge is gone, and what it paid is
//! read out of the transaction consensus admitted.
//!
//! # Non-destructive broadcast
//!
//! Nothing here consumes evidence to produce a transaction.
//!
//! - [`close_start`] builds and signs; both endpoints commit the exact
//!   bytes before they are handed to a chain. A crash between signing
//!   and that commit loses a signature nobody has, and the retry signs
//!   again at whatever height the cursor has reached. A crash after it
//!   leaves bytes [`advance_close`] re-sends verbatim, and the kernel
//!   admits at most one contest per edge — so a resubmission is not a
//!   second close, it is the same one.
//! - The certificate the start carries stays in the journal it was
//!   admitted into. The start holds a copy; it never becomes the only
//!   copy.
//! - [`adjudicated_close`] is derived, not retained: its payouts come
//!   from the contest record consensus itself holds, so it can be
//!   rebuilt after any crash from a fresh finalized read. What cannot be
//!   rebuilt after the edge is consumed is the exact close *bytes* — and
//!   nothing needs them, because [`observe`] recognises settlement by
//!   the edge being closed rather than by matching bytes it kept.
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! It signs no cooperative freeze. That exit needs both parties'
//! signatures over one amount and no exchange in this crate negotiates
//! them; a freeze built here would be a transaction with one signature
//! and a place to put the other.
