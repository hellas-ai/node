//! Canonical private records of a paid job: what was authorized, what
//! came back, what it cost, and which scalar certificate paid for it.
//!
//! # What these records are for
//!
//! Consensus settles one number. An [`EarnedCertificate`] names a payment
//! edge, its terms, and a cumulative amount, and the kernel pays out
//! against exactly that (`crates/kernel/src/work.rs`). Nothing in it says
//! which job was done, at what price, in which environment, or whether
//! the answer was ever delivered. These records are the private chain
//! that makes the scalar mean something:
//!
//! ```text
//! both signatures
//!   -> authorization digest / work_id
//!   -> provider-signed result_digest
//!   -> client-signed PaymentBindingV1(work_id, result, certificate)
//!   -> client-signed EarnedCertificate(credited + price)
//!   -> kernel payout
//! ```
//!
//! There is no provider signature between the result and the payment,
//! and there is deliberately no room for one. The provider has already
//! co-signed the authorization that fixes the price and signed the
//! result that earns it; a third provider signature restating those two
//! numbers would add no authority to either, and would be a second place
//! for the price to be written down.
//!
//! A chain of digests is not by itself a ledger: every link above can be
//! rebuilt truthfully for a job that was already paid for, at a fresh
//! cumulative, and read alone it is indistinguishable from a second job.
//! [`CreditLedger`] is what makes it a ledger. It holds the whole of the
//! cross-call state — the credited amount and the jobs already paid for
//! — and it is the only thing here that says a job is paid for at most
//! once.
//!
//! None of it is consensus input, and none of it is on L1. It lives here,
//! in the neutral protocol crate, so the provider and the client have one
//! implementation of these digests rather than two that agree until they
//! do not.
//!
//! # Profile
//!
//! These bodies are the transitional `SIGNED_TRANSCRIPT_FULL_REEXEC_V1`
//! profile: a fixed-price Evaluate job whose correctness the client
//! establishes by full independent reexecution. They grant no
//! correctness-game right. That is why the authorization has its own
//! domain — `hellas.work.paid-job-authorize.v1` — and deliberately not
//! the v4 game domain `hellas.work.job-and-dispute-authorize.v2`
//! (`workflows/roadmap/concurrency-design-v4.md:410-413`): two different
//! objects under one domain is a replay vector, and a body from this
//! profile must fail a game decoder by tag before any field is read.
//!
//! # Bounded preimages
//!
//! Every fixed record is hashed with [`SingleChunkHasher`], which
//! *asserts* rather than errors once a preimage reaches
//! [`hellas_xet::MIN_CHUNK_SIZE`]. Each body here is fixed-width, so each
//! complete preimage has a compile-time maximum, and both preimage
//! shapes — record and channel id — are asserted below. The four
//! variable-length preimages — the generation policy, the identity
//! artifact, the prepared input bundle, and the canonical output — use
//! the streaming [`XetFileHasher`] instead, which has no such limit and
//! which agrees with one-shot [`Digest::hash`] under every write
//! segmentation.
//!
//! # Signatures
//!
//! Signatures ride beside these bodies, never inside them. The provider
//! signs the authorization and the result; the client signs the
//! authorization, the payment binding, and the kernel's earned digest.
//! Every digest below binds the network and the channel, so a body
//! lifted from one channel is not a body in another.
