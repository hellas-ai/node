//! Which channel this endpoint will work over, and whether it may.
//!
//! # What a configured channel is
//!
//! [`WorkChannelDescriptor`] is everything an endpoint was told about
//! one paid channel: the network, both edge ids, the complete tag-2
//! payment terms — which embed the complete tag-4 bond — the private
//! policy body and its salt, the execution policy, and the three
//! measurements the omission contest's economics depend on. It is
//! configuration, and none of it is evidence.
//!
//! [`WorkChannelDescriptor::check_ready`] is what turns it into
//! evidence, by comparing it against one finalized read the caller
//! supplies. What it establishes is that at that read: both edges are
//! live, both hash to the configured terms, both name the parties those
//! terms fix, the bond is leased to *this* payment edge, no contest is
//! open, the funded edge still clears the omission inequality, and the
//! height is inside the admission horizon.
//!
//! That the read is coherent — one block, one state root, one database
//! snapshot — is the caller's, not this module's. See
//! [`ObservedChannel`].
//!
//! # Why the terms are hashed locally
//!
//! A finalized edge carries a terms *hash*, not a terms body. Nothing
//! read off the chain says what shape the terms have, who the parties
//! are, or what the bond covers. So the descriptor's own bodies are
//! hashed here and compared with the edge's commitment; the shape is
//! never inferred from the lookup. That is also why the payment terms
//! are carried whole rather than as a hash: the bond edge, the parties,
//! the admission horizon, and the policy commitment are all read out of
//! them, and a hash answers none of those questions.
//!
//! # What readiness does not claim
//!
//! Not that the objects were authenticated. In this milestone's trusted
//! mode the values come from a chain process inside the endpoint's trust
//! boundary and carry no membership proof; readiness is a statement
//! about what was reported, and the report's provenance is the
//! operator's.
//!
//! Not that a correctness game is available. This profile has no
//! challenge path, so the section-7 provider-deterrence inequality is
//! not checked and is not claimed. What *is* checked is that the
//! omission bond exceeds the payment capacity it insures
//! ([`check_collateral`]), so that omitting a response can never pay:
//! the contest is implemented, and that is the one number it needs.
//!
//! Not that a job may be signed. That is a per-signature question with
//! its own deadlines, and it is [`ReadyChannel::check_signable`].
