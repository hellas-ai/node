//! The offline two-Open handshake, as one artifact that is passed back
//! and forth.
//!
//! # Why a bundle at all
//!
//! Opening a work channel takes four signatures over two transactions,
//! made by two parties who do not share keys and, in this milestone, do
//! not share a network. Generic Open verifies both party authorizations
//! (`crates/kernel/src/tx/mod.rs`), so a provider-only bond signature is
//! not a transaction — somebody has to carry half-signed bytes between
//! the two processes, and "the parties exchange signatures out of band"
//! is not an implementation.
//!
//! [`WorkChannelSetupBundleV1`] is that carrier. It has exactly three
//! revisions, each one strictly extending the last:
//!
//! 1. `BondProposed` — P names the funding it will stake and the tag-4
//!    terms, and signs the bond open.
//! 2. `PaymentProposed` — C countersigns that exact bond, names the
//!    funding it will lock as capacity and the tag-2 terms over that
//!    bond, and signs the payment open.
//! 3. `Complete` — P countersigns that exact payment. Both transactions
//!    are now executable, and only P holds them both.
//!
//! # What it establishes
//!
//! [`WorkChannelSetupBundleV1::check`] verifies every signature the
//! revision carries against the open hash the kernel will compute, by
//! the party the terms name — so an endpoint countersigns a bond only
//! after checking the other side's signature over the same bytes, not
//! after being told it exists.
//!
//! It also establishes the two structural facts a signature cannot: the
//! payment terms embed *this* bond, by both witness and derived edge id,
//! and no coin funds both opens. A duplicated funding id would produce
//! two transactions that cannot both execute, after both parties have
//! signed both.
//!
//! # What it does not establish
//!
//! That the coins exist, are unspent, or are owned by the party
//! offering them. Nothing in a signed body says so, and only a
//! coherent finalized read does — which is the preflight P runs
//! immediately before broadcasting, not a property of these bytes.
//!
//! That any of this survives a crash. A bundle is a value; the journal
//! that fsyncs each revision before its next signature is exported is
//! durable endpoint state, and durable endpoint state is P3's.
