//! Server-side middleware over generated `Dispatcher` impls.
//!
//! The codegen-emitted `XServer<H>: Dispatcher<T>` types are intentionally
//! transport-agnostic and accounting-agnostic — they own only the
//! method-id match + the user's handler. Cross-cutting concerns
//! (per-peer accounting, admission policy, tracing, OTel) belong in
//! middleware wrappers around them, not in the codegen output.
//!
//! [`AccountingDispatcher`] is the first such wrapper: every inbound
//! that carries a peer identity bumps the corresponding `PeerManager`
//! record. That's the producer side of the data flow that
//! `PeerDirectory::ranked_known_peers` consumes when emitting
//! `Node::get_known_peers` responses — without this middleware, that
//! consumer is forever surfacing an empty directory.

/// Wraps any `Dispatcher<T>` and records each inbound on a
/// `PeerManager` before forwarding to the inner dispatch.
///
/// The accounting call is fire-and-forget — its result is discarded.
/// Failure modes (peer-table full, etc.) do not block dispatch; the
/// peer is still served, the operator just won't see its counters
/// bumped. That trade-off matches the policy split: this middleware
/// is observability, not admission. An admission-policy middleware
/// (rate-limit / authz) would be a separate wrapper composed on top
/// of this one.
