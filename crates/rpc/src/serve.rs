//! Server-side middleware over generated `Dispatcher` impls.
//!
//! The codegen-emitted `XServer<H>: Dispatcher<T>` types are intentionally
//! transport-agnostic and accounting-agnostic — they own only the
//! method-id match + the user's handler. Cross-cutting concerns
//! (per-peer accounting, admission policy, tracing, OTel) belong in
//! middleware wrappers around them, not in the codegen output.
//!
//! [`AccountingDispatcher`] is the first such wrapper: every inbound
//! that carries a peer identity bumps the corresponding `PeerManager`
//! record. That's the producer side of the data flow that
//! `PeerDirectory::ranked_known_peers` consumes when emitting
//! `Node::get_known_peers` responses — without this middleware, that
//! consumer is forever surfacing an empty directory.
