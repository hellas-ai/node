//! The paid-work wire: how a client proposes one job and a provider
//! accepts or refuses it.
//!
//! # What crosses the wire
//!
//! Canonical private records, and nothing else. `AcceptWorkRequest`
//! carries the exact bytes of a [`PaidJobAuthorizationV1`] and a
//! [`PreparedPaidInputV1`], not a protobuf transcription of their
//! fields, because the two signatures on this exchange are over digests
//! of those bytes. A protobuf spelling beside them would be a second
//! definition of what both parties signed, agreeing with the first until
//! one of them gained a field.
//!
//! # The order
//!
//! Both endpoints obey the same rule, which is [`crate::work_store`]'s:
//! **the state that authorises a signature is fsynced before the
//! signature leaves the process.**
//!
//! The client reserves its nonce, builds and signs the authorization,
//! and journals the signature — all before the request is handed to a
//! transport. The provider journals the client's proposal, which is what
//! reserves its compute credit, then signs, then journals its own
//! signature, and only then answers. A crash anywhere in either sequence
//! costs a round trip and at most one burnt proposal nonce: the retry
//! finds the durable record, returns the retained bytes, and reserves no
//! credit twice.
//!
//! The one thing neither endpoint can promise is delivery. A provider
//! that crashes after its journal commits and before its reply reaches
//! the client has co-signed a job the client does not know is accepted;
//! the client's retry is what resolves that, and the acceptance deadline
//! is what bounds how long it may try.
//!
//! # Idempotence
//!
//! By `work_id`, which is the authorization's own digest. A retry of the
//! same proposal returns the retained co-signature without re-checking
//! deadlines — the answer was already given, and a deadline that passed
//! since cannot unsay it. A *different* proposal while one is in flight
//! is refused, never queued.
//!
//! # Running what was accepted
//!
//! [`run_accepted_work`] is the second half, and it obeys the same rule
//! in the one place it matters most: the running marker is fsynced
//! before the backend is called. It is not a wire exchange — there is no
//! Run RPC here — but it is the same journal, the same channel, and the
//! same `work_id`, so it lives beside the acceptance that authorised it.
//!
//! The property it exists for: **for one `work_id`, at most one call in
//! the lifetime of one journal ever invokes the backend.** Two durable
//! facts carry it, and neither alone does. The provider burns each
//! proposal nonce it sees, so one `work_id` opens at most one job, ever
//! — ending a job does not give its nonce back. And the journal takes a
//! running marker only from the accepted phase, so one job crosses into
//! running at most once; every later call reads that phase and answers
//! from it instead of invoking. Deleting the journal file forfeits both,
//! which is why the claim is scoped to one journal's life and not to one
//! `work_id`'s.
//!
//! A third durable fact is about the crash rather than the count. A
//! marker found on the disk by a process that did not write it makes the
//! state indeterminate, and that does not stop a second invocation — the
//! phase already does — it stops the *resolution*: a recovered process
//! may not sign a result for an invocation it cannot know it made.
//!
//! # Delivering the answer
//!
//! [`ProviderEndpoint::deliver`] and [`ClientEndpoint::receive`] are the
//! third exchange, and they obey the same rule at the one moment it is
//! irreversible: the release marker — which is what debits this client's
//! delivery credit — is fsynced before a byte of plaintext is returned.
//!
//! It is one unary call carrying the whole answer, and that is the
//! profile rather than a shortcut. Nothing is released before the
//! terminal result is durable and its price is reserved, so there is no
//! prefix to stream; what the client gets is the signed result and the
//! transcript the provider's own journal holds, and what it does with
//! them is rebuild one from the other before anything is stored.
//!
//! A lost response costs a round trip. The provider answers a second
//! call from the same spool and re-commits the same marker as a
//! redundant step, so one job's plaintext is debited once however many
//! times it is fetched.
//!
//! # Paying for it
//!
//! [`ClientEndpoint::pay`] is the fourth exchange, and it is where the
//! private evidence meets the one number consensus settles. There is no
//! invoice call in front of it and no provider signature over a price:
//! the provider has already co-signed the authorization that fixes the
//! price and signed the result that earns it, so what a third signature
//! could add is nothing, and what it could disagree with is everything.
//!
//! The client derives the amount itself — its own credited total plus
//! the price its own authorization fixed — signs the certificate and the
//! binding that says what that certificate bought, and fsyncs both
//! before either leaves the process, through the ledger that says this
//! job has not been paid for before.
//!
//! Then the provider fsyncs the same pair before it acknowledges
//! anything, deriving the same amount from its own ledger, and that same
//! record is what retires the job's compute and delivery credit. There
//! is no moment at which this client is owed service for a payment the
//! provider's disk does not hold.
//!
//! # Closing
//!
//! Both endpoints sign a close start, retain its exact bytes before
//! they leave, and hand them to consensus until a finalized block says
//! the contest opened or the window they were signed for has passed.
//! It is symmetric because the deadlock is: a provider that stops
//! answering leaves the client's funded edge locked, and a client that
//! stops paying leaves the provider's earnings unspendable.
//!
//! What neither endpoint does here is wait. `advance_close` is one
//! step, and the caller that owns a clock is the one that repeats it.
