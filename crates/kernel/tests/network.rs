//! Network separation of kernel authorizations.
//!
//! The property under test: an authorization is valid on the network it
//! was made for and on no other. It is stated twice on purpose — once
//! over the hashes, which is cheap and catches a dropped
//! `network.encode_to(...)`, and once end-to-end through
//! [`hellas_kernel::State::apply`], which is what actually decides
//! whether a replayed witness settles.
//!
//! An edge id is not enough on its own. Two deployments with the same
//! genesis allocations derive the same coin ids, hence the same edge
//! ids, hence — before this binding existed — the same open hash. The
//! open-hash test pins exactly that case: identical funding, identical
//! terms, different network, and the witness must not carry over.

#![allow(clippy::expect_used)] // a rejected fixture is a test bug worth panicking on
#![allow(clippy::indexing_slicing)] // tests may index; the panic-freedom lock targets src
