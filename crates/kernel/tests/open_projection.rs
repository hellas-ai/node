//! What [`open_projection`] says an open will do, against what the open
//! path actually does.
//!
//! Two halves, and both are needed.
//!
//! The **differential** half opens real transactions against a real
//! store and requires the projection to have named, in advance, the
//! exact edge id, the exact locked value, reserve and committed
//! close-fee schedule, the exact timeout payout the terms had to commit,
//! and the exact rejection for every input the chain refuses. That is
//! what catches a projection whose plumbing reaches for the wrong
//! funding count, the wrong cost function, or the wrong half of a party
//! split.
//!
//! The **vector** half pins the same quantities to numbers computed by
//! hand from the fee schedule, and it is not redundant. Projection and
//! consensus deliberately share one implementation of every formula
//! here, so a change to a shared formula moves both answers together and
//! no differential could see it. The vectors are the independent
//! restatement: perturb the open cost, the reserve cost, the lifetime
//! rent, the timeout close price, or the value subtraction, and exactly
//! these assertions fail.
//!
//! Every schedule but one is nonzero. The deployed chain compiles
//! `KERNEL_FEES = Fees::ZERO`, and a suite that exercised only that
//! would pass against an implementation that had quietly dropped a term.
//!
//! On the development filesystem this repo lives on, `cargo` has been
//! seen to reuse a stale prebuilt binary and report failures the current
//! source does not produce; if these fail inexplicably, `touch` a source
//! file and confirm the run says "Compiling" before believing it.
