#![allow(clippy::redundant_pub_crate)]

//! The exclusive bond lease: the record a payment channel takes out
//! against the stake that insures it.
//!
//! # Why a bond needs a lease at all
//!
//! A work-stake bond is one provider's stake and one client's recourse.
//! Nothing in the bond edge itself says which channel it is currently
//! insuring, and without that the same stake could back several payment
//! channels at once — every one of them priced as if it had the whole
//! stake to slash. The lease is the record that makes the bond
//! exclusive: a payment open creates it, and a second payment open
//! naming the same bond finds the slots occupied and is refused.
//!
//! It is also what tells a bond close whether anyone still has recourse
//! against it. An unleased bond has no challenge exposure, so its
//! `Timeout` is immediate; a leased one must wait for the admission
//! horizon it committed to.
//!
//! # Two chunks, and why absence is decided by both
//!
//! The record is 139 canonical bytes, so it spans two
//! [`RegistryChunk`]s. "No lease" therefore means *both* derived slots
//! are empty, and every other shape — one present chunk, a wrong chunk
//! count, a value that does not decode, a record naming another bond —
//! is a fault rather than absence. A close that read a half-written or
//! corrupted lease as "unleased" would take the immediate exit out from
//! under a live channel's recourse.
//!
//! # What the lease does not decide
//!
//! Nothing about the money. The scalar a channel settles at, the contest
//! that establishes it, and the payouts it produces are all
//! [`crate::work`]'s and [`crate::tx::work`]'s, and none of them reads
//! this record: the lease is checked once, at payment open, because the
//! payment edge's own id already commits to the bond it names (see the
//! `bond_edge` field of [`crate::WorkPaymentTerms`]). Nothing of the
//! correctness game is here either — no live-game pointer and no
//! challenged bitmap. A field no transition writes is not state held
//! ready for later, it is 288 bits of consensus surface every node
//! stores and no rule reads, so the game slice adds its own record
//! shape with the transitions that mutate it.
//!
//! Abstract counterpart: none. Like the rest of the registry, the lease
//! has no Quint var and no ITF trace; `models/registry.md` records which
//! properties that leaves to Rust tests alone — including bond
//! exclusivity itself.
