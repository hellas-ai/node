//! Concrete edge terms and their deterministic commitment.
//!
//! No direct abstract counterpart — the L1 model treats terms as opaque
//! constants (`TimeoutHeight`, `MakerPayout`, `TakerPayout` in
//! `models/types.qnt`). The Rust kernel commits to a structured [`Terms`]
//! body and binds it via [`TermsHash`] so closes can carry only the
//! commitment, not the full payload.
//!
//! [`Terms`] computes its [`TermsHash`] at construction and stores it
//! alongside the body. Callers that need the hash get a field load; no
//! type that contains a `Terms` ever needs to cache `terms_hash`
//! separately.
//!
//! # Shapes
//!
//! Three shapes: `Basic` (tag 0), [`WorkPaymentTerms`] (tag 2), and
//! [`WorkStakeBondTerms`] (tag 4). Tags 1 and 3 decode to a rejection
//! and carry no promise. [`Terms::profile`] is the one classification,
//! and it is exhaustive, so a shape added later is a compile error at
//! every site that decides policy from the shape.
