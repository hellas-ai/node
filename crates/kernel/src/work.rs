#![allow(clippy::redundant_pub_crate)]

//! Work-payment close vocabulary: the earned certificate, the two Move
//! bodies, the pending record they write, and every digest that binds
//! them.
//!
//! # What the close contests
//!
//! One scalar. A work channel's adjudicable state is the greatest valid
//! client-signed cumulative earned amount the provider durably admitted
//! before its terminal cutoff — not a work set, not a lane tip, not a
//! membership root. Everything here exists to move that one number onto
//! L1 and to make omitting it unprofitable.
//!
//! A unilateral close is therefore three transactions: a
//! [`PaymentCloseStart`] that stakes a claim and opens a bounded window,
//! at most one [`PaymentCloseResponse`] that raises it, and a
//! `Proof::Adjudicated` close that pays the result out. The window is
//! information-theoretically necessary: an immediate close cannot
//! distinguish a world where no greater certificate exists from one where
//! the counterparty holds it privately, so the holder is given exactly
//! one chance to speak.
//!
//! # What this module is not
//!
//! It is the vocabulary, not the rules and not the insurance. The four
//! transitions that read and write these values live in
//! [`crate::tx::work`]; the exclusive lease that makes a provider's stake
//! back this channel and no other lives in [`crate::lease`], and is taken
//! at payment open rather than at close, so nothing here consults it. The
//! close kinds an edge admits — `Freeze` and `Adjudicated`, and
//! deliberately not `Timeout` — are fixed by [`crate::Terms`], which is
//! also where the admission horizon's meaning is written down.
//!
//! Abstract counterpart: none. The pending record is registry state, and
//! `models/registry.md` lists which properties of this close — the
//! scalar's monotonicity, the bond's conservation, the one-contest and
//! one-response rules, absence-versus-fault — are therefore established
//! by Rust tests alone.
//!
//! # Bounded preimages
//!
//! Every digest below is a [`SingleChunkHasher`] result, and that hasher
//! *asserts* rather than errors once a preimage reaches
//! [`hellas_xet::MIN_CHUNK_SIZE`]. These run on the apply path, where a
//! panic is a node halt and not a rejected transaction, so each preimage
//! is written by a `*_preimage` function whose compile-time maximum is
//! asserted below. The split also lets the tests count the exact bytes
//! each preimage emits instead of trusting the arithmetic here.
