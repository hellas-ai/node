//! The arithmetic an open performs, and the projection that lets a
//! non-kernel caller perform it without a store.
//!
//! An endpoint that wants to open a channel has to know, before it signs
//! anything, what the chain will charge it, what the edge will be worth,
//! and what id that edge will have. It cannot ask a node: the open does
//! not exist yet. Its only alternatives are to copy the formulas or to
//! guess, and a wrong guess is a rejected transaction with funding
//! already committed to a signature.
//!
//! So the formulas live here once. `apply_open` reaches them through
//! `open_debits` and `check_work_profile_open`; an endpoint reaches the
//! same functions through [`open_projection`]. There is no second copy
//! that agrees today.
//!
//! # What the projection does not answer
//!
//! Everything that needs the chain's state or a signature: duplicate
//! funding ids, whether the coins exist and who owns them, whether the
//! derived edge is already live, whether the authorizations verify,
//! whether the named bond is live and unleased. Those checks live around
//! this arithmetic in `apply_open` and cannot be inferred from values. A
//! caller that projects an open has computed what the chain would
//! compute; it has not been told the chain will accept it.
//!
//! One arithmetic rule is also deliberately outside the projection: the
//! comparison of the terms' committed timeout payouts against the total
//! this edge requires. The requirement is *returned* — see
//! [`OpenProjection::timeout_payout`] — because a caller building terms
//! needs that number before it can write payouts that satisfy it, and a
//! function that could only grade finished terms could not be used to
//! finish them. The comparison itself remains `apply_open`'s, and both
//! sides read the requirement from `timeout_payout`.
