//! Close witnesses.
//!
//! A [`Proof`] is the kernel-visible *shape* of why an edge should
//! close. Each variant maps to exactly one validation kind: `Mutual` and
//! `Freeze` → [`crate::SigVerifier`], `Timeout` and `Adjudicated` →
//! kernel inline structural checks against committed terms and staged
//! registry state. No close consults an external verifier.
//!
//! Abstract counterpart: `models/types.qnt::Proof` (witness ADT) and
//! `models/verifier.qnt` (`proofOk`, `payoutsBound`). The Quint module
//! treats these as pure predicates over opaque verifiers; the kernel
//! defers the same checks by routing each variant to the matching
//! verifier impl (or to its own inline check for Timeout).
