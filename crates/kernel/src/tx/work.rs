//! The work-payment close transitions.
//!
//! Two moves and two proofs, in the order they run:
//!
//! 1. [`apply_start`] stakes the opener's amount and opens a bounded
//!    response window, writing the one pending record.
//! 2. [`apply_response`] lets the certificate's beneficiary raise that
//!    amount exactly once, and marks the omission bond forfeit when the
//!    raise is the client's own contradiction of its own start.
//! 3. [`check_adjudicated`] pays out whatever the contest ended on.
//! 4. [`check_freeze`] is the cooperative alternative and can join at any
//!    point — but it can never settle below a contest already reached,
//!    and it can never erase a penalty the contest proved.
//!
//! Every one of them reads the same single registry slot through
//! [`read_pending_close`], and every one of them treats a present but
//! unreadable value as an invalid transaction rather than as absence.
//! That asymmetry is the whole point: absence is a *permission* here —
//! it lets a start open a contest and lets a freeze skip the pending
//! rules — so anything that could be mistaken for it has to be refused.
