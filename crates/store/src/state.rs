//! Where a node keeps what the store learned.
//!
//! Two files, one directory:
//!
//! - `fastresume.bin` — what has already been hashed
//!   ([`crate::fastresume`]).
//! - `adopted-caches` — which HuggingFace caches `adopt` was pointed at
//!   ([`crate::hf_cache::adopted_caches`]).
//!
//! Both live beside the rest of this node's state and never inside the
//! HuggingFace cache. That cache belongs to somebody else's tool, and
//! writing our bookkeeping into it is how programs end up blamed for
//! each other's bugs — and how a `huggingface-cli delete-cache` takes
//! our records with it.
//!
//! `HELLAS_STORE_DIR` moves the directory, for a node whose state does
//! not live under `$HOME` and for tests, which must never read or write
//! the developer's own.
