//! A content store addressed by Xet file hash.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! A Nix store, or a BitTorrent client's view of its own disk: an entry
//! is named by a hash of its content, so *where it came from is not part
//! of its identity*. That single property is what makes everything else
//! work — any source producing the right bytes is as good as any other,
//! so content can be substituted from a local HuggingFace cache, a peer,
//! an HTTP seed, or a tarball without any of them being privileged.
//!
//! We reuse HuggingFace's exact hashing scheme ([`hellas_xet`]), which
//! is the trick the whole design turns on: **an existing HuggingFace
//! cache is already a populated store**. Adopting one is indexing, not
//! downloading.
//!
//! # Indexing produces two things, and the second is the valuable one
//!
//! [`ContentStore::index`] returns the content id *and* the chunk list.
//! Keeping only the id would throw away the expensive half of a pass we
//! must make anyway.
//!
//! The chunk list is the metainfo, in the BitTorrent sense. A Xet file
//! hash is a Merkle root over exactly those descriptors, so holding them
//! makes any later *partial* fetch of that file verifiable. This matters
//! because HuggingFace's reconstruction protocol returns no chunk hashes
//! at all — content arriving from an untrusted peer is otherwise
//! unverifiable until the whole file is reassembled, which is a fine way
//! to waste fourteen gigabytes on a liar.
//!
//! # Never trust an id you did not compute
//!
//! HuggingFace advertises an `x-xet-hash` per file. For Xet-native
//! uploads it is exactly the Xet hash of the content. For legacy-LFS
//! content bridged into Xet it is **not** — measured, on real files,
//! with matching sha256 confirming the bytes were the ones HF meant.
//!
//! So an advertised id is a hint that lets us skip work when it agrees,
//! and never a key. Ids in this store are ones we computed: a
//! content-addressed store cannot defend a key it did not derive from
//! the bytes.
