//! The paid-work configuration file: what an operator writes down, and
//! what a node refuses to start without.
//!
//! `--work-config` was a path whose *presence* advertised two ALPNs and
//! whose contents were never opened. A node cannot mount a channel from
//! a path, so this is the schema and the loader for what is in it: the
//! three-part chain cross-check, the six validator URLs a write is
//! fanned to, the journal root, the bilateral route table, the two
//! policies this provider works under, the watcher's poll cadence, the
//! funding it expects a payment edge to carry, and the shortest response
//! window it will sign terms over.
//!
//! # The cross-check is not an anchor
//!
//! `(network_id, genesis_payload_digest, threshold_identity)` is a
//! fail-fast configuration cross-check. Only the threshold identity ever
//! authenticates a finalized block; the other two are how a node started
//! against the wrong chain says so at startup instead of at the first
//! settlement. The identity is decoded here, by the same constructor
//! consensus verification uses, so a typo is a startup error and not a
//! block that never verifies.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! There is no Start-span field, no mutual-margin field, and no journal
//! cap. All were deleted: the Start span is fixed at 64, a work-payment
//! edge has no Mutual route, and the journal's active and checkpoint
//! ceilings are constants it enforces on itself
//! ([`MAX_ACTIVE_JOURNAL_BYTES`]), so any of them appearing in a file is
//! an operator configuring something that does not exist. Every struct
//! below denies unknown fields, which is what turns that into an error
//! naming the field.
//!
//! Nor is there a measured artifact. An earlier design derived the
//! response window and an alarm margin from latencies a bootstrap probe
//! recorded, pinned to the digest of the measuring binary; no deployed
//! node ever carried one, and every rebuild would have invalidated it.
//! The two numbers that design would have produced are written down
//! here instead, by the operator, and [`WorkConfig::provider_policy`] is
//! the whole of what is made from them.
//!
//! [`MAX_ACTIVE_JOURNAL_BYTES`]: hellas_rpc::work_store::journal::MAX_ACTIVE_JOURNAL_BYTES
