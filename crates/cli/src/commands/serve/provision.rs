//! Making the offers a fresh provider has nothing to serve without.
//!
//! `WorkRunner::discover` answers `WorkSetup` from the setup journals it
//! finds under the configured work root, and finding is the whole of what
//! it does. A correctly configured provider with no journal therefore
//! refuses every client that dials it, and the paid path is unreachable
//! from a clean install. This is the operator's step that writes them.
//!
//! # The order is the journal's, and none of its rules are here
//!
//! Three library calls. [`SetupStore`] is opened as the provider's half
//! of one bond, the immutable history floor is armed, and
//! [`SetupEndpoint::propose_bond`] signs the stake and journals it before
//! there is anything to export.
//!
//! Arming is first because it has to be: the setup state refuses
//! "recording revision 1 before arming its scan floor", so the floor is
//! not a preparation this command chose to do early but the step every
//! later one is refused before. The floor is a finalized height and the
//! payload digest at it, and the setup's own history must name that
//! digest as the parent of its first block. So it is read from a
//! validator rather than written down by an operator: a floor naming a
//! block this chain does not have is a setup whose history can never be
//! contiguous, and nothing later would say so out loud.
//!
//! # Exit means durable
//!
//! [`SetupStore::commit`] fsyncs a revision before it returns, and this
//! command still reopens the journal and replays it before printing
//! anything. That reopen is the one `WorkRunner::discover` will do, run
//! early: an operator told the offer exists has been told about the disk,
//! and about a file whose exclusive lock is already free for the runner
//! to take.
//!
//! # One recourse backs one route
//!
//! A provider offer reserves a route, a bond, and every coin funding that
//! bond. A second offer is safe only when all three are disjoint from every
//! provider offer already under the root. Existing peers come from the
//! durable route table, while existing coins come from the bond funding in
//! each retained setup bundle. Revision one is enough: it holds the funding
//! before a client has answered, while [`SetupState::funding_coins`] is still
//! empty because there is no executable Open yet.
//!
//! Discovery, route agreement, and funding comparison all happen while the
//! candidate is only a value. The candidate journal is not opened until
//! afterwards, so every collision is refused before a floor is written or a
//! bond signature is made.
//!
//! # What the operator chooses, and what is built
//!
//! Every number in the bond is the operator's and this command invents
//! none of them. Two parts of the shape are not choices: a stake bond is
//! funded by its maker alone, so the taker's side of the funding is
//! empty, and its timeout pays the staking party and nobody else, so
//! there is one payout and it names the provider's own key. A second
//! payout to that same party would only raise the close cost the payout
//! has to clear. The kernel checks the rest when the Open reaches it —
//! that the payout total is the edge's close value, that the price cap
//! covers a job, that the timeout is ahead of the block including it —
//! and re-spelling any of that here would be a second answer to a
//! question consensus already answers.
//!
