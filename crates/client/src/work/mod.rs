//! The client half of a paid job, from a co-signed authorization to a
//! result this client has checked itself.
//!
//! # The one thing this module is for
//!
//! Everything before it moves authenticated bytes. This is where the
//! client decides the bytes are *right* by reproducing them itself, and
//! it is the difference between paying for a reproduced result and paying
//! for a signature.
//!
//! # The order, and why it is this order
//!
//! 1. **Fetch.** One unary call, whose answer the endpoint journals
//!    before returning it. The journal is where the delivered result is
//!    rebuilt from the delivered transcript, checked against the
//!    provider's key, and timed against the terminal deadline; none of
//!    those is spelled again here.
//! 2. **Reproduce.** The engine is handed the bundle the *journal*
//!    holds — not the one the response carried, and not one this module
//!    reassembled — because that bundle's digest is inside the
//!    authorization both parties signed and is re-checked every time
//!    the journal is opened.
//! 3. **Catch up, then record.** The cursor is caught up to the finalized
//!    tip, and only then is the outcome fsynced — a match that a
//!    certificate may be signed from, or a permanent refutation that no
//!    payment can follow. A match reaches
//!    [`payment::pay_for_checked_result`], the step that turns the
//!    reproduced answer into a payment.
//!
//! Reversed, the third step would be a claim about a re-execution that
//! had not finished, and the second would reproduce bytes nothing durable
//! bound to the job.
//!
//! # What a match means, and what it does not
//!
//! It means: an engine this client chose, given the inputs this client
//! signed for, produced the answer the provider signed — the same
//! tokens in the same order, stopping for the same reason, with the same
//! output artifact and the same usage. It does not mean the provider
//! computed rather than recalled that answer, and it is no stronger than
//! the engine behind [`reproduce::Reproducer`]. See [`reproduce`].
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! No retry loop and no deadline timer. The cursor they would be
//! bounded by does move — `hellas_rpc::work_close::catch_up` is what
//! moves it, and `ClientEndpoint::catch_up` is how this endpoint asks
//! it to — but nothing here owns a clock, and a loop written without
//! one polls until it is killed. What this module gives a caller
//! instead is the provider's own answer about whether asking again
//! could help — [`CollectOutcome::NotReady`] — so the policy that owns
//! a clock can be written over a signal rather than a guess.

///    journal write and the re-execution are the unlocked work.
/// 2. **Post-answer catch-up.** Once there is an answer, the cursor is
///    caught up to the finalized tip. This is the barrier: a re-execution
///    that stalled past the height the client signed to pay by advances
///    the cursor past it here, so the durable step below — and the
///    payment it enables — is judged against a fresh clock rather than
///    the stale one the fetch left.
/// 3. **Checked apply.** A match is recorded as [`ClientEndpoint::matched`];
///    a mismatch is recorded as [`ClientEndpoint::refuted`] — a permanent
///    refuted terminal, so the job can never afterwards be paid for and a
///    second proposal of it fails.
///
/// Idempotent in every step, so a caller whose process died anywhere in
/// it may call this again with the same `work_id`: the delivery is
/// answered from the provider's spool at no second credit cost, the
/// journal takes the same result as one, the engine is deterministic,
/// and a repeated match or refutation is the same one.

/// journal refused it — which is what it does for a late receipt or a
/// transcript that does not rebuild the result — [`CollectError::CatchUp`]
/// when the post-answer catch-up failed, and [`CollectError::Unchecked`]
/// or [`CollectError::Refuted`] for the two outcomes of the re-execution
