//! The client's own re-execution: does the answer this provider signed
//! reproduce from the inputs both parties agreed to?
//!
//! # Why it sits here
//!
//! Because the re-execution must not be able to reach the provider.
//! Everything here takes bytes and returns a digest; nothing here opens a
//! connection, reads a store, or consults a piece of provider metadata
//! that is not inside the authorization the client itself signed. A
//! module inside the executor could not credibly claim that. This one
//! can: the engine arrives through [`Reproducer`], never through a
//! dependency, and `hellas-client`'s closure holds no `hellas-executor`
//! and no model weights under any feature it has. The boundary that makes
//! the re-execution separate is the trait, not a crate.
//!
//! # What is reproduced, exactly
//!
//! [`reproduce`] rebuilds `PaidJobResultV1::canonical_output_digest` from
//! scratch and returns it. That digest binds the whole answer — the
//! output token ids in position order, the final position, the stop
//! reason and matched stop-token witness, the output text artifact, and the usage counts
//! (`hellas_rpc::protocol::work::canonical_output_digest`) — so
//! reproducing it reproduces all of them. Every part of it except the
//! tokens, stop reason, and matched stop-token witness is *derived* here from the job's own
//! inputs, through the same [`completed_text`] the provider's artifact
//! store uses; the tokens and the stop reason come from re-running the
//! model.
//!
//! What it does not check, and what is checked elsewhere: that the result
//! is the one the provider signed, that it names this job, and that the
//! transcript it summarises is this job's — those are the endpoint
//! journal's, established when the delivery was recorded
//! (`hellas_work::work_store::ChannelState`), on commit and on every
//! replay. Repeating them here would be a second opinion about a question
//! already settled.
//!
//! # What it cannot do
//!
//! It cannot be more separate than its [`Reproducer`] engine is. The
//! milestone this re-execution exists for wants a *second* deterministic
//! implementation of the same model, and there is not one in this
//! repository: the executor has exactly one backend. So this module
//! defines the seam and derives everything around it, and the separation
//! of the answer itself is exactly the separation of whatever is plugged
//! in. Running the provider's own implementation here would reproduce its
//! bugs as faithfully as its correct answers, and would not be a
//! re-execution worth the name.
//!
//! It also cannot say the provider *computed* the answer rather than
//! recalling one. No result protocol can; the sole proposal nonce bounds
//! the damage to the one job the client actually asked for.
