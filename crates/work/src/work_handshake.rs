//! The two-Open handshake on the wire: how two endpoints that have
//! never met get a channel to do paid work on.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! [`hellas_rpc::protocol::work_bundle`] is the artifact, and it says of
//! itself that "somebody has to carry half-signed bytes between the two
//! processes". [`crate::work_store::setup`] is the journal that fsyncs
//! each revision before the signature it carries is exported. This is
//! the carrier those two were written for, and it adds no rule to
//! either: every check here is one of theirs, run by
//! [`SetupStore::commit`], and this module's whole content is who calls
//! it and in what order.
//!
//! # The order
//!
//! One method, two round trips, and the client drives both because the
//! client is the party that dials.
//!
//! 1. The client asks with nothing. The provider answers with the
//!    revision-1 bond proposal its own journal already holds — already
//!    signed, already durable, because the step that signed it
//!    (`SetupEndpoint::propose_bond`) journaled it first.
//! 2. The client journals that proposal, countersigns the bond, names
//!    the funding and terms of the payment channel it wants over it,
//!    and journals *that* — revision 2 — before it is sent.
//! 3. The provider journals the arriving revision 2, countersigns the
//!    payment, journals revision 3, and only then answers with it.
//!
//! Both transactions are now executable and only the provider holds
//! them both, which is what `SetupState::decide` resumes from.
//!
//! The rule this obeys is `work_store`'s and it bites hardest at step
//! 3: the co-signature is inside the record, so committing the record
//! first is the whole of what stops a signature leaving a process that
//! has no memory of making it. There is no signing in the handler and
//! then a write afterwards, and there is nothing here that could be
//! reordered into one.
//!
//! # Why no connection binding
//!
//! `DeliverResult` needs one because a `work_id` is an identifier: it
//! travels, and anyone holding one could make the provider release
//! plaintext and debit the real client's credit. Nothing here has that
//! shape. The request carries no identifier — it carries the artifact
//! itself, and every signature in that artifact is verified against the
//! party its own terms name before a byte of the answer is produced.
//!
//! So the two things a bearer capability would give an attacker are
//! both absent. A stranger cannot make the provider countersign
//! anything, because a revision 2 requires the client's signature over
//! both open hashes and those hashes are over this bond's terms, this
//! funding, and this network. And replaying a captured revision gains
//! nothing: the journal recognises what it already holds, writes
//! nothing, and returns the bytes it had already given the party that
//! signed them.
//!
//! # Who may sign what
//!
//! Not decided here either. `WorkChannelSetupBundleV1::check` reads the
//! signing party out of `bond_terms.parties` — maker is the provider,
//! taker is the client — so a client that tried to propose a bond, or a
//! provider that tried to propose a payment, fails its own journal's
//! commit. There is no role argument on any function below, because a
//! role argument would be a second answer to a question the signatures
//! already answer.
//!
//! # What the provider will sign it over
//!
//! That *is* decided here, and it is the one judgement this module
//! makes. Revision 2 is the client's, and four of the fields in it are
//! the client's free choice: `private_policy_commitment`,
//! `omission_bond`, `omit_response_blocks`, and
//! `start_validity_blocks`. A provider that countersigned whatever
//! arrived would be staking on terms it had never checked.
//!
//! So [`PaymentAdmission`] carries the provider's own configuration and
//! [`ProviderChannelPolicy::admit`] runs the gates
//! `WorkChannelDescriptor::open` already had — the credit-policy
//! commitment against this provider's salt, the execution policy, the
//! settleability of the funding it expects, and the omission
//! economics — before the countersignature is made. No gate is spelled
//! a second time here.
//!
//! What that refusal costs a provider that skips it is bounded rather
//! than fatal: `check_ready` re-runs the economics against the funded
//! edge, so terms that fail them yield a channel this endpoint will
//! never admit work over. It is bounded by the stake sitting locked
//! until the horizon, and no automatic step returns it — see
//! `hellas_work::work_open`'s note on `SetupDecision::TimeoutBond`.
