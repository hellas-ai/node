//! Posting the two Opens: the driver that turns a completed handshake
//! into a channel on chain.
//!
//! # What was missing
//!
//! [`SetupState::decide`] is §6's five-way recovery machine and it has
//! been complete for a while. What it never had was anything to drive
//! it: something that reads one coherent finalized state, asks it what
//! to do, records that step before taking it, and reads the blocks back
//! to find out whether it landed. [`advance_setup`] is that, and it adds
//! no decision of its own — every branch below is a `SetupDecision`, and
//! the two it does not act on say so.
//!
//! # Durable before broadcast
//!
//! The same rule [`crate::work_close`] obeys for a close, in the same
//! order: the marker is committed and fsynced, and only then is the
//! transaction handed to a sink. A crash between the two leaves a
//! journal that says the bond was submitted when it may not have been,
//! and that is the safe half — the next run re-decides from the chain,
//! sees no bond, and submits the *retained* bytes again. A resubmission
//! is the same Open and not a second one: `apply_open` refuses it twice
//! over, once because the funding coins the first one consumed are gone
//! and once with `ApplyError::EdgeExists` for the edge already there.
//!
//! The other order is the one that cannot be recovered from: broadcast
//! first, crash, and the journal has no record that a transaction
//! carrying this provider's signature is in flight.
//!
//! # Where the channel begins
//!
//! [`SetupRecord::Complete`] carries the block the payment Open landed
//! in — its height, its payload, and its parent's payload, which is the
//! cursor a channel watcher starts from. None of those three can be
//! derived from the objects: a live edge says the Open was accepted, not
//! where. So [`advance_setup`] reads finalized blocks until it finds the
//! one whose accepted transactions contain an Open deriving this payment
//! edge.
//!
//! The scan starts at the successor of the journal's immutable
//! [`SetupRecord::ScanArmed`] floor. Its first parent must be the armed
//! payload and every later parent must be the preceding payload. Submission
//! markers are deliberately absent from this calculation: who happened to
//! submit an Open cannot move the observation floor past an authorization a
//! counterparty may already have put on chain.
//!
//! # Who mounts
//!
//! Every step that opens the channel journal hands it back in
//! [`SetupAdvance::mounted`]. There are three: the completion, the
//! close-only mount, and the completed-journal shortcut — which matters
//! because it is the only branch a restarted process reaches a finished
//! setup by, and a caller that had to mount for itself there would have
//! to mount for itself after every restart.
//!
//! A caller receives its channel; it never builds a second one. The
//! alternative is re-deriving the settlement from the armed descriptor
//! and re-running this replay outside the library — and the two
//! spellings come apart at exactly the places that matter. The
//! settlement comes from the coherent live edge rather than from what
//! configuration expected, and the origin block's own post-Open moves
//! are replayed because the mount's cursor already sits on that block.
//! Neither is visible from the descriptor alone.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It does not take an unleased bond's Timeout back.
//! [`SetupDecision::TimeoutBond`] is returned to the caller as
//! [`SetupProgress::TimeoutBond`] and nothing here submits it: the
//! journal has no record with which to mark that submission, and this
//! module submits nothing it cannot write down first. Nothing else in
//! this workspace submits one either — `Tx::timeout_close` has no caller
//! outside tests — so a provider whose setup ends there gets its stake
//! back only by an operator building and sending that transaction.
//!
//! It does not exchange revisions with the peer. That is
//! [`crate::work_handshake::send_setup_exchange`], bracketed by its
//! prepare/apply helpers, and a caller runs the two in the obvious order:
//! exchange until the bundle is complete, then drive until the journals
//! record it.
